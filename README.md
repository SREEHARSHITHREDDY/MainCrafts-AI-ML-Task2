# MainCrafts-AI-ML-Task2

## Feature Engineering, Model Optimization & Performance Comparison

### Overview
This project is part of the **MainCrafts AI & Machine Learning Internship – Task 2**.  
The task focuses on improving a machine learning regression model using feature scaling, training multiple algorithms, evaluating their performance, and selecting the best-performing model.


### Dataset
- **California Housing Dataset**
- Loaded using `scikit-learn`
- Target Variable: Median House Value (HousePrice)


### Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib


### Workflow
1. Load and explore the dataset  
2. Separate features and target variable  
3. Apply feature scaling using StandardScaler  
4. Split data into training and testing sets  
5. Train multiple regression models:
   - Linear Regression  
   - Ridge Regression  
   - Decision Tree Regressor  
6. Evaluate models using RMSE and R² metrics  
7. Compare results and select the best model  
8. Visualize Actual vs Predicted values  


### Evaluation Metrics
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
- R² Score


### Files Included
- AI_ML_Task2_Model_Comparison.ipynb
- AI_ML_Task2_Report.pdf
- README.md


### Conclusion
This project demonstrates an industry-level machine learning workflow by applying preprocessing, training multiple models, and selecting the best model through proper evaluation techniques.
